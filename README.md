# Earthquake_Challenge

## Purpose

The main purpose of this challenge is to create a project that shows the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. Further, to create a separate layer for all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. In the last, add a third map (dark-v10) to see the earthquake data.
